 #Matrix Correlation Analysis
 Assignment Number: 1
 Author: Bhavana Parupalli
 Date: 2/14/2024
 Programming Language: Python(3.8) 
#Dependencies:-
pandas
seaborn
matplotlib

#Input:-
Two matrices, matrix1 and matrix2, loaded from external text files (matrix1.txt, matrix2.txt)

#Short Script Description:-
This Python script analyzes the correlation between two matrices (matrix1 and matrix2). It calculates the Pearson correlation matrix for each individual matrix and the Pearson correlation between the two matrices using pandas and numpy. The script then generates heatmaps to visualize the correlation matrices.

#Usage:-
1. Ensure to have the required dependencies installed (`pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib numpy`).
2. Provide the input matrices in text files: matrix1.txt and matrix2.txt.
3. Run the script.

#output:-
Heatmaps illustrating the correlation matrices for both matrix1 and matrix2.
combined correlations.csv: A CSV file that combines cancer-specific correlations between the two matrices and includes the overall correlation between the matrices at the end.
